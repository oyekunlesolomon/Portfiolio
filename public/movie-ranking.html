<h1>Top movies according to Solomon</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>
    Troy, was a very interesting movie with a lot of lessons to learnt.<br />
    It shows the consequences of indulgence, greed, pride and lack of appreciation all in one movie.
</p>
<p>
    I will rate Troy 8/10.
</p>

<h3>Finding Forrester</h3>
<p>
    A movie that displays the benefits of following up on your inquisiiveness and being bold enough to take challenges.<br />
    It show the values of keeping to your promise(integrity) even when all the odds are against you and also repaying the good turns.
</p>
<p>
    I will rate Finding Forrester 7/10.
</p>
<h3>Message and Messenger</h3>
<p>
    The ignorance of not understanding the message can lead to being taken advantage of, this was well displayed in the movie. <br />
    Also, the humility to unlearn and relearn when you see results you desire in someone else is very critical.
</p>
<p>
    I will rate Message and Messenger 8/10.
